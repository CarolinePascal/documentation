# About Me

Hi, I’m **Charles Azam**, CIO & Software Engineer at **Jimmy Energy**. I build code-driven engineering platforms, harness AI & cloud technologies, and streamline workflows to empower teams.

!!! tip "Specialization"
    Implementing cutting-edge tech tools in industries that aren’t used to them—bridging the gap between traditional engineering and modern software practices.

!!! info "The Challenge"  
    It’s normal for developers to collaborate on thousands of files in a single repo, yet many teams still email around `report_v2_final_rev.xlsx`.

!!! success "Case Study: Jimmy Energy"  
    We organized our entire engineering company on a single Git monorepo. By recoding our engineers’ tools from the ground up, we now enjoy cleaner data and seamless AI integration.

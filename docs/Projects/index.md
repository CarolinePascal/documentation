# Projects

Welcome to my personal projects page.

Based on what I learned at Jimmy, I had an idea. We already managed to do engineering using only open source technologies; python git, ect...

Now, what if I could use an AI agent to create an engineering project automatically ?

To do that, I had to develop two independant repositories:

- [Pyforge](./pyforge.md): a minimalist python library to do engineering as code
- [AIEngineer](./aiengineer.md): an ai agent to use pyforge

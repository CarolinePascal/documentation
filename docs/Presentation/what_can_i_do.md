# What can I do ?

I believe technology is the key to enhancing a company's productivity.

## 🌟 Streamlined Collaboration  
- **Centralized Repositories**  
  Keep all models, analyses and documentation in a single Git workspace—no more “final_rev3.xlsx” floating around.  
- **Automated Pipelines**  
  Routine tasks (simulations, report generation, email notifications) run automatically via lightweight CI/CD workflows.

## 🤖 AI-Powered Productivity  
- **On-Demand Assistance**  
  AI agents (RAG, LangChain, SmolAgents) draft summaries, explore “what-if” scenarios and flag anomalies—no coding expertise required.  
- **Actionable Insights**  
  Machine-learning pipelines transform raw data into clear recommendations, so you spend less time sifting and more time deciding.

## ☁️ Scalable, Secure Cloud  
- **Pay-as-You-Grow Architecture**  
  AWS best practices optimize costs and simplify management.  
- **High Availability**  
  Tools and dashboards stay online and responsive, even under peak demand.
